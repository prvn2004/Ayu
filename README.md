A platform to connect doctors with patients for better medical facilities


IT WAS FIRST PROJECT WE STARTED WORKING ON AS 1ST YEARER'S. A GROUP OF HIGHLY PASSIONATE, AND TALENTED(KINDA) PEOPLE. ALL OF OUR GROUP WAS LIKE BEST IN CODING AT SPECIFIC THING. 
THEN A FUCKER CAME AND DEMOTIVATED THE WHOLE GROUP IN THINKING THAT WE SHOULD STUDY AND LEAVE THIS AND START ON THIS AFTER COLLEGE. TILL THEN WE WILL LEARN MANY THINGS.🤡. HE DO SOME ML THING.

LEARNING NEVER LET PESSIMIST PIECE OF SHIT IN YOUR GROUP.
